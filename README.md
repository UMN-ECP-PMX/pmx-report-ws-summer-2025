**Title:** Reporting workflow in pharmacometrics analyses using Quarto  
**Date:** July 16, 2025 (Wednesday)   
**Duration:** 1 Day 

**Instructors:**
  1.	Mutaz Jaber
  2.	Shen Cheng

**Overview:**

Mathematical models developed from pharmacometric analyses are increasingly used to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) of drugs. The implementations of pharmacometric modeling and simulation (M&S) analyses are growing in clinical practice, drug development and regulatory assessment. 

Without an efficient reporting workflow, presenting the results of M&S analyses can be technically challenging given the large amount of numerical input and output that need to be summarized and accurately described in a scientific/regulatory report, both tabularly and graphically. In addition, developing a pharmacometric model typically requires repeated model development and evaluation cycles, necessitating the need of programmatic scientific writing to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of a report throughout the model development process. 
Quarto provides a unified authoring framework for pharmacometrics, combining your code, its results, and your text. Quarto documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, presentations, and more. 

The aim of this workshop is to introduce techniques for reporting in PK/PD analysis and efficientizing your reporting workflow using Quarto, a technical writing engine. 

This workshop is developed based on previous IU CTSI workshops: 
  1.	quarto-CTSI-2024: <https://github.com/Mutaz94/quarto-CTSI-2024>
  2.	quarto-tips: <https://github.com/Mutaz94/quarto-tips>

**Learning outcomes:**
  1. Understand the basic structure of PK/PD analysis outputs
  2. Learn hands-on experience creating technical documents using Quarto
  3. Streamline and reproduce your analysis.
